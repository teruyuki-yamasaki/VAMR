# VAMR - Vision Algorithms for Mobile Robotics

## About
[Vision Algorithms for Mobile Robotics](http://rpg.ifi.uzh.ch/teaching.html) is a course of the ETH Zurich Master in Robotics, Systems and Control, lectured by Prof. Dr. Davide Scaramuzza, the director of the Robotics and Perception Group. He introduces us to the fundamental computer vision algorithms used in mobile robotics:

This course contains the exercise parts, in which students can gain hands-on expericences of implementing the computer vision algotithms provided during the lectures in order to have a deeper understanding of each topic. In this repository, I place what I have implemented for each exercise with some descriptions. While the main language in the exercises is MATLAB, I implement the algorithms in Python.
